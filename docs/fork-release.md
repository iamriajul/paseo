# Fork Release Pipeline

This is the low-plumbing path for maintaining a personal fork that carries local patches while still regularly pulling upstream changes.

## What The Fork Publishes

- Desktop installers and updater manifests are published to the fork's GitHub Releases.
- Docker daemon images are published to `ghcr.io/<fork-owner>/paseo`.
- npm global-install tarballs are published to the fork's GitHub Releases.
- The build stamps package versions inside CI from the release version you choose, so fork-only releases do not require committing package-version churn.

The desktop app's updater metadata is generated from the repository running the workflow. A build produced in `your-user/paseo` checks `your-user/paseo` for updates, not `getpaseo/paseo`.

Fork desktop builds also stamp a fork bundle ID from the GitHub owner. For example, `iamriajul/paseo` builds use `sh.paseo.desktop.iamriajul` instead of `sh.paseo.desktop`.

## Version Choice

Use a monotonically increasing version in your fork.

Stable-channel example:

```text
v0.1.900
```

Beta-channel example:

```text
v0.1.105-beta.100
```

The release metadata parser currently supports stable `vX.Y.Z` and beta `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` tags. If you publish beta builds, set the desktop app's release channel to beta in settings. Stable-channel users only see stable tags.

## Desktop From GitHub UI

Run `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml` with:

| Input           | Value                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `tag`           | Your chosen version tag, e.g. `v0.1.900` |
| `platform`      | `all`, `macos`, `linux`, or `windows`    |
| `checkout_ref`  | The branch, tag, or SHA to build         |
| `publish`       | `true`                                   |
| `rollout_hours` | `0` for immediate personal rollout       |

The workflow creates or updates the GitHub Release in the fork and uploads installers plus Electron updater manifests.

### macOS Signing

If these secrets are present, macOS artifacts are signed and notarized:

- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_ID`
- `APPLE_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

If they are missing, the workflow builds unsigned and unnotarized macOS artifacts. Those are usable for personal testing with the normal macOS Gatekeeper bypass, but they are not a smooth public distribution experience.

## Docker Daemon Image From GitHub UI

Run `.github/workflows/docker.yml` on the branch you want to publish with:

| Input            | Value                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `paseo_version`  | The same version without `v`, e.g. `0.1.900` |
| `publish`        | `true`                                       |
| `publish_latest` | `false` for beta, optional for stable        |

The image is published as:

```text
ghcr.io/<fork-owner>/paseo:<version>
```

Use that image for remote daemon hosts when you want them to run the forked server code.

## npm Global Install Daemon From GitHub UI

If a remote host uses `npm install -g @getpaseo/cli`, publish forked npm tarballs to the same GitHub Release and install the CLI tarball URL instead of the upstream npm package.

Run `.github/workflows/npm-global-install-release.yml` on the branch you want to publish with:

| Input          | Value                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `tag`          | Your chosen version tag, e.g. `v0.1.900` |
| `checkout_ref` | The branch, tag, or SHA to build         |
| `publish`      | `true`                                   |

Then install or update the daemon package on the Linux host:

```bash
npm install -g "https://github.com/<fork-owner>/paseo/releases/download/v0.1.900/getpaseo-cli-0.1.900.tgz"
```

The CLI tarball keeps the package name `@getpaseo/cli`, but its internal `@getpaseo/*` dependencies point at tarballs from the same GitHub Release. That means npm installs the forked daemon code without needing access to the upstream npm scope or a private package registry.

## Android APKs

Fork Android APKs are built locally in GitHub Actions, not on Expo Cloud. The workflow runs `expo prebuild`, applies the fork app identity, signs the generated Gradle release build with your keystore, and uploads:

```text
paseo-vX.Y.Z-android-<fork-suffix>.apk
```

For `iamriajul/paseo`, the APK defaults to:

| Setting    | Value                 |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| App name   | `Paseo iamriajul`     |
| Package ID | `sh.paseo.iamriajul`  |
| URL scheme | `paseo-iamriajul`     |
| Updates    | Upstream EAS disabled |

Configure these repository secrets once:

| Secret                      | Value                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`   | Base64 encoded `.jks` keystore         |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password                      |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`         | Keystore alias, usually `paseo-upload` |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`      | Key password                           |

Generic `vX.Y.Z` fork tags now publish the Android APK when those secrets are present. You can also dispatch `.github/workflows/android-apk-release.yml` with `tag` plus optional `checkout_ref` to rebuild a release from a branch without moving the tag.

## Web App Deploys

Generic `vX.Y.Z` fork tags skip the hosted web app deploy workflow. That avoids failing personal fork releases that do not have Cloudflare credentials configured. If you want to deploy the fork's hosted web app, push an `app-vX.Y.Z` tag or dispatch `.github/workflows/deploy-app.yml` with the required Cloudflare secrets available.

## Keeping Up With Upstream

Keep a long-lived branch for your fork changes, then regularly merge or rebase upstream `main` into it. After resolving conflicts and pushing the branch, run the desktop and Docker workflows again with a higher version.

The Browser localhost routing feature requires both sides to be updated:

- Desktop app built from the fork.
- Every host daemon, local or remote, running a fork build that advertises `server_info.features.tcpTunnel`. Use either the forked Docker image or the forked npm global-install tarball.
